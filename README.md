# HVOLib
HVOLib is the base library that all of our Arduino boards run. It integrates with [HVORest](https://github.com/wtollett-usgs/arduino-hvorest) to provide access to all of the sensors we typically attach to our Arduino boards.

Project has been archived and is now available at [code.usgs.gov](https://code.usgs.gov/vsc/hvo/arduino-hvolib).
